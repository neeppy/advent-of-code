## Advent of Code

Hello there, stranger! I see you've stumbled upon **AOC county, Neepland**. Only you 
know what you're looking for here. What I can tell you is that here you'll find my 
solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems, along with the 
problem details, so you don't have to go searching.

Each day of each year is organised under its own directory and has its own individual
files (e.g. `2024/dec1/part1.ts`). The setups may be similar each day, but they usually 
evolve day by day (adding new utils, or changing the file structure).

This year (2023) is all written in NodeJS, using TypeScript... As for the others... 
Who knows? Maybe [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)? 
Or maybe [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)? We'll see.
