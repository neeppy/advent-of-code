## Part One

Compare first half of the string with the second half. If they are the same, add the number to the total.

Full input answer: `12599655151`.

## Part Two

This is a more generic approach to the part 1. This time, however, instead of splitting the string in half, we split it in parts (beginning with 2 parts).
If all the parts are the same, add the number to the total.
